			<h1>Hello, my name is Margaux</h1>

			<img src="images/profile.png" alt="Margaux Lacoste" id="circled">

			<p>
				I love tennis, kitesurf and travels. I'm a tennis teacher since 2017. I really like to spread the passion of sport around me, especially tennis' one. I will always be ready for a kitesurf session. I'm also looking for new adventures and new trips all around the world.

			<h2>Tennis' lover & teacher</h2>
			<p>
				I practice tennis since I'm 4 years old. I started competitions very young and acquired technical knowledges that's why the president of my club asked me in 2017 if I wanted to help a teacher with her tennis group. I accepted and few years later I was able to have my own group and to prepare my own tennis' training. I have the IF diploma that legally allows me to teach tennis to kids younger than 18 years old. Before moving for my studies, I taught tennis every saturday at TCLT. I also work for Pyla's tennis club during summer holidays.

			<h2>Kitesurf woman</h2>
			<p>
				I started kitesurf thanks to my dad when I was 15. Because I am very competitive, I took part in the Engie Kite Tour 2022. It was the occasion to race but also to meet french professionnal kitesurfers like Lauriane Nolot or Axel Mazella. I finished first in my category. Moreover I had the opportunity to give some interviews for Kiteboarder Mag but also to turn of video for FFV's youtube channel.

			<h2>Traveller</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a travel's lover. One of my goals is to go all around the world to discover new cultures but also to make unforgettable memories. I've already travelled a bit on my own (Ireland for example), with my family (Tanzania, Brazil) and with my friends (Spain). I really like languages that's why I am currently learning russian in addition of english and spanish.
